CSC 460/560: Design and Analysis of Real-Time Systems
=====================================================

Project 1
=========

Authors: Darren Prince and Jakob Leben


Overview
--------

Goals:

- Use joystick to control servo and aim IR emitter towards target.
- Use joystick press to emit code as IR modulation code.
- Use time-triggered architecture

Components
----------

(Add details)

- Arduino Mega 2560 (http://www.arduino.cc/)
- Joystick...
- Servo motor...
- IR emitter...

Task scheduling and communication
---------------------------------

We have the following periodic tasks:

- <Task 1>:
    - purpose, period
- <Task 2>:
    - purpose, period
- <task 3>
    - purpose, period

Here is a diagram of the time-triggered scheduled:

We have the following state variables:
